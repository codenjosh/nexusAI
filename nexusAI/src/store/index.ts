You should seek medical attention promptly if: your fever exceeds 103째F (39.4째C), persists for more than 3 days, is accompanied by severe headache, difficulty breathing, rash, or confusion.

The Mediterranean and DASH diets are well-researched eating patterns associated with various health benefits.
